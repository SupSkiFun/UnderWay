Something within the existing script and the below doesn't work.  It never changes.

Fixed and Random Path Stuff - make two functions within an advanced function?  Or just command line it?

Verify values in production...below doesn't seem to work....?

foreach ($r in $rdms) {
$sl = Get-ScsiLun -VmHost $yvrc71n4 -CanonicalName $r
$np = Get-ScsiLunPath -ScsiLun $sl
$rn = get-Random -Minimum 0 -Maximum $np.count
Set-ScsiLun -ScsiLun $sl -MultipathPolicy "Fixed" -PreferredPath $np[$rn].LunPath
Set-ScsiLunPath -ScsiLunPath $np[$rn]
}

Attach a script method to a custom object:

$vv = Get-EC2Vpc | Show-EC2Vpc

$uu = {
	$this |
		Select-Object -Property * -ExcludeProperty Object |
			ConvertTo-Json -Depth 4
}

Add-Member -InputObject $vv -MemberType ScriptMethod -Name json -Value $uu

Need to include this method on applicable custom objects going forward!  Pay heed to JSON depth
and (non)requisite properties!

Possbile to include when making CustomObject?

Or insert akin to ? $lo.PSObject.TypeNames.Insert(0,'SupSkiFun.AWS.EC2Instance.Info')
